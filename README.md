Embodied Motion Verification for Fair Ticket Access
The Problem

High-demand ticket releases force fans to compete against automated bots operating at superhuman speed.

Traditional defenses like CAPTCHA, SMS verification, and identity uploads either:

Add friction for legitimate users

Or fail against increasingly sophisticated automation

Ticketing needs a system that protects fairness without punishing real fans.

Our Insight

Bots simulate logic.
Humans inhabit motion.

Automation can replicate clicks.

It cannot replicate embodied, real-time device movement.

KineticAuth leverages that asymmetry.

What We Built

KineticAuth is an adaptive, motion-based authentication layer designed for high-traffic ticket onsales.

Instead of static puzzles or biometric ID checks, we verify physical presence using device motion.

Security becomes interaction.

How It Works
1️⃣ Baseline Tilt Verification

Users complete a lightweight tilt interaction.

We measure:

Orientation stability

Motion smoothness

Completion timing

If motion falls within human thresholds → access granted immediately.

Most fans never experience additional friction.

2️⃣ Adaptive Risk Engine

If motion patterns are inconsistent:

TILT → ANALYZING → STEP-UP

Step-up activates only when elevated risk is detected

3️⃣ Rhythmic Step-Up

Escalated users complete a shake-to-beat challenge.

This tests:

Sustained motion consistency

Reaction timing

Real-time embodied engagement

Bots cannot convincingly replicate rhythmic motion under live constraints.

Privacy by Design

No biometric identity storage

No facial recognition

No personal data retention

Motion processed locally

Data discarded after verification

We verify physical presence — not identity.

Why It’s Different

Most systems rely on:

AI classifiers

Identity checks

Static puzzles

KineticAuth introduces:

Embodied verification.

Low friction for real fans.
Escalation only when risk increases.
Security without surveillance.
