# Beat challenge audio

Place one audio file per artist in this folder. The shake-to-the-beat verification will play the file for the event’s artist.

**Expected filenames (by event slug):**

| Event slug      | Filename           | Artist            |
|-----------------|--------------------|-------------------|
| coldplay        | `coldplay.mp3`     | Coldplay          |
| lil-baby        | `lil-baby.mp3`     | Lil Baby          |
| partynextdoor   | `partynextdoor.mp3`| PARTYNEXTDOOR     |
| drake           | `drake.mp3`        | Drake             |
| adele           | `adele.mp3`        | Adele             |
| beyonce         | `beyonce.mp3`      | Beyoncé           |

Supported formats: MP3, WAV, OGG, M4A (browser-dependent). Use MP3 for best compatibility.

If a file is missing, the challenge falls back to a metronome click only.
